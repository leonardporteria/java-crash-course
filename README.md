## Exercises
### Program 1:
Write a program to generate 100(int) numbers. Traverse and display "Fizz" if the current number is divisible by 3, display "Buzz" if the current number is divisible by 5, and display "FizzBuzz" if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

> Sample run:
``` bash
1
2
Fizz
4 
Buzz
Fizz
7
...
100th
```

### Program 2:
This program will prompt the user to input an integer number which will determine the corresponding events in month.

### Program 3:
Sort an n size array of integer given by the user. Allow the user to sort the integer ascending or in descending order.

> Sample run:
``` bash
Enter the size of array: 5
Enter the value of element 1: 8
Enter the value of element 2: 6
Enter the value of element 3: 3 
Enter the value of element 4: 1 
Enter the value of element 5: 9
Sort ascending[1] or descending[2]?: 2

Sorted array in descending order: 9 8 6 3 1
```


> Sample run:
``` bash
Enter the size of array: 5
Enter the value of element 1: 8
Enter the value of element 2: 6
Enter the value of element 3: 3 
Enter the value of element 4: 1 
Enter the value of element 5: 9
Sort ascending[1] or descending[2]?: 3
Invalid input, try again.
Sort ascending[1] or descending[2]?: 1

Sorted array in ascending order: 1 3 6 8 9
```



### Program 4:
Create 3 different classes with different properties and methods. Use the Main class to display its properties, and perform its methods. Must use constructors/overloaded constructors.

### Program 5:
Assuming you are making a program that should create different object per different Professor.

- Make a class `Professor` that should hold the common attributes of all the professor in the school.

- Make another class that will inherit the Professor class, and add the unique identifier of the professor (`employeeID`, `name`, `department`, `saray`)

- Create a static variable `numberOfProfessors` that will determine the total number of professors in the campus.

- Create a method that will display the total number of Professors.
